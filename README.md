# Shadlib

This was supposed to be Shad's "personal quirks" idiomatic helper library, but it's currently a pile of experimental code that might eventually become useful helpers.

Nothing in this repository should be considered to be in a usable or dependable state.  I'd like to split out useful subsets of the functionality into modules that you can depend on in the usual way; if there's something specific you'd like to have available, open an issue to request a spinoff.
